In this section, we compare our method with three other papers, \ci
Plankton~\cite{2017-Prabhu}, \cii Plankton-neo~\cite{2018-PrabhuEtAl}, and \ciii
Alembic~\cite{2019-MoonEtAl}. All of this papers targeting to verify the network
behavior, which is the same motivation as our work. However, each of them uses
different methodology to achive it.

\textbf{Plankton} Plankton is a configuration verifier managing the large header
space by using equivalence partitioning and explore protocal execution by
checking explicit-state model. It focuses on two phases of verification on
network, \ci data plane verification and \cii software verification. The data
plane verification tool checks the correctness of all possible data plane
behavior by analyzing the large header space. Software verification, on the
other hand, is used to gather all the software execution path. The significant
benefit of using plankton is that it is efficient even processing large-scale
network. While it is not considered the middleboxes of the network so the
quality of result will decline when the network is complicated with multiple
middleboxes in it.

\textbf{Plankton-neo} plankton-neo is a variant verification from plankton.
plankton-neo includes the middlebox as part of verification. Instead of
providing a new designed model for each middlebox in the method, it uses
emulation to guarantee the correctness of the middlebox behavior remain the
same. The advantage of the plankton-neo is that it successfully cover the
problem addressed in plankton by considering the middleboxes inside the target
network. However, it losses the efficiency as it will consume a lot of time on
execution the middlebox emulation apparently.

\textbf{Alembic} Alembic is a new proposed middlebox modeling method. It uses
different network rules as input and collect the output as the model of that
middlebox. By categorize the output, it can simplify the final model to make it
much more concise. Since it uses the symbolic model, the accuracy of the
middlebox model is improved comparing to other previous research. However,
Alembic treat all type of middlebox as a blackbox. As our method has the
background knowledge of the middlebox, our model is expected to be much accurate
than Alembic.
