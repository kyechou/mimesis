\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

% summary of the work and future plans
We propose a new approach of model extraction from software network functions
using binary analysis. The results show the possibility of getting an accurate
model, in spite of some limitations in terms of scalability. In the future, we
plan to explore more in this direction by learning more about binary analysis
and source-code analysis, to be able to generate models with less human
intervention.
