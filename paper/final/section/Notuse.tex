% future challenges: function pointer, need of program specific knowledge
In the future, we plan to finish the implementation of the whole analysis
procedure, and possibly automating it. However, a main challenge of our work is
the fact that in order to do analysis, we still need to assume some level of
understanding of the target program implementation, such as the system call APIs
the program uses, and fully automation without prior knowledge remains very
difficult, if not impossible, at this stage. Another challenge would be dynamic
behavior of the program, such as function pointers that cannot be determined
statically. Though it may be possible to inject concrete values to some
variables to the program through angr and to get the concrete values of those
function pointers, it would definitely increase the complexity of the analysis.
